comp mode:
- set true after initial loading to avoid global var problem
- the attempt limit and time limit is enforcedby forcing invinsible and disabling the toggle
- 2 seperate arrays for save names and save progres are used to save the attempt count. everytime your atempt update it also updates in the save.
- attemps count down when someone restarts a run. if someone finish a run the save data wil be reduced by 1 while the ingame one stays even, this way if you rejoin, you still get your attempt used.
- time limit is checked via regular match time rule
